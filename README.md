## Overview of Project

### Purpose
We are assisting the company V.Isualize in summarizing ride-share data by city type by creating a map to demonstrate how weekly fares vary per city type.

## Results

Below is a breakdown of our ride-share data per city type:

As we can see, urban areas have the most drivers which causes the average fare per driver and average fare per ride to be way less than rural cities. In turn, rural areas are typically located outside of urban cities. Therefore, there may be less demand for drivers or ride-share programs, customers may have longer distances to travel per ride which would cause the fare to be higher. 

So this really comes down to classic supply and demand. The more drivers you have in a high demand area, the less a customer may pay per ride as you can observe in the chart below:

## Summary
In summary, urban areas have higher demand and higher total fares per week versus suburban and rural areas. Therefore, it can possibly produce higher profit margins for the company and drivers. Drivers in urban areas have an higher opportunity to perform more rides and make more money overall despite rural and suburban area having a higher average fare per driver.
